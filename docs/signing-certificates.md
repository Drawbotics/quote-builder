### How to create a signing certificate on Mac OS

1. Open XCode and start a blank project (we just need to access the settings)
2. Go to Preferences > Accounts
3. Add your Apple ID to the accounts if you haven't already (choose Apple ID in the type of accounts)
4. Once the team (of yourself) is created, click on "Manage Certificates"
5. Click on "+" and choose Mac Development, then Done.
6. Open Keychain Access to view your certificates and look for one containing "Mac Developer"
7. Double click the certificate and beside "Common Name" should be the identity.
